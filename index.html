We happened to have finance class together, and everyday, she cheated on her assignments by copying my work. Eventually, at the end of the school year, there was a dance. I wrote on a crumpled notebook piece of paper, <b><i>Will you go to the dance with me. P.S. and girlfriend?</i></b>, and handed it to a friend who happened to be a Thao. Pana was confuzzled at first, but soon after the misunderstanding, Pana did not waste any moment of hesitation and accepted the offer.<b>"</b></p>

Everyone hated him cause he constantly teased people. Despite what tony thinks, we actually had health class together first. We were partners to share what our presentation will be about. I did my presentation on online bullying and Tony did his on some kind of <i>black tar cocaine?</i> I remembered nodding my head and listening, and at the end of all his long words, he asked, <b><i>you have no idea what I'm saying huh</b></i>. I replied with <b><i>nope</b></i>. After that semester, we had finance along with civics class together where we sat next to each other. I was not a fast working student and always took longer to do my homework. One day, I got a nudge from the loud giant next to me to copy his homework and obviously took up the opportunity. From there on, it was constant note passing in class and was finally official with the last note asking me to be his girlfriend.<b>"</b></p>
