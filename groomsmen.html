                                We barely knew about each other in middle school; however, we finally hung out during freshman year of college after his mom gave me a ride to orientation (thanks to someone bailing 
								on me as a ride). Dave and his family are integral to my success during and after college, and his family also makes bomb @$$ food!!! We have done many crazy things 
								together such as performing at events like the time when we taught dance to a crew, MacGyver'ing poor man solutions like the time when we had to travel a mile to do 
								baskets of laundry on a computer chair, and of course, meeting a lot of amazing people along the way. The one thing that I love about Dave is his ability to make anyone feel 
								warm and welcomed, and <b>did I mention that he is the best speech giver ever?!</b>

                                I was a freshman in a glass college study room, and Carmen Ho (one of the bridesmaid) brought Peter to meet my friends and I. Instantly at that moment, I knew that I had 
								to befriend this dude because he had a swagger hat. My first memories with him was doing an Oreo race with our face. My favorite memory was convincing a large group of 
								people to pretend that they forgot his birthday and did not care. Then later in the week, we surprised him with a birthday party, showed an amazing dance video and showered 
								him with lots of love. The one thing that I love about Peter is his ability to go the extra mile to help anyone for any reason, and <b>did I mention that he was a Lapras

                                During middle and high school, Jerry was reserved and quiet. But after getting to know him more in college, I soon found out that we have a lot in common such as animes and 
								games. Throughout college and even until now, we played countless hours of an abundance of games together, most notably 7 Days to Die, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch and Apex 
								Legends. His humor is dark, and he makes witty and hilarious remarks that gets me cracking up. The one thing that I love about Jerry is his ability to be down to try new
								things or revisit old ones, and <b>did I mention that he is above average in every single game?!</b>
